# Take Home Project

This is a project to review basic skills of applicants applying to be a Reelit developer. This is a relatively simple project, however don't feel pressured to finish quickly or get it perfect we are mostly just looking to have some insight into your thought process and approach a task like this.

___

## Outline of Task

We would like you to construct a web application that takes the output (basic reelit templates in an array) from a GET request to the placeholder API endpoint listed below, and then filters/orders that data slightly and displays it on the page.

*https://my-json-server.typicode.com/reelit/reelittakehome/templates*

The created web page should open with a "GET TEMPLATES" button in the center. When this button is pressed, hide the button, fetch the data from the endpoint, filter/order it as described below and then display the filtered/ordered data on the page with some basic formatting (however you would like).

**Filtering:**  
Filter the data to only show templates with `"template_genre": "genre_1"`, remove any other genres.

**Ordering:**  
Order the data by `"total_length"` desc.



## Platform Choice

Python - where possible, with any frameworks/libraries.  
Basic HTML and CSS, with any frameworks/libraries.  
JavaScript can also be used if needed, with any frameworks/libraries. 

Use any IDE/tools that you are comfortable with.



## Task Requirements

Feel free to spend as much or as little time on the exercise as you like as long as the following 2 requirements have been met.  
  
1. Provide details of your workings and thought process as we have outlined below.  
2. Please make your code compile and run in as little steps as possible.  



## Details of Your Workings

A simple README.md containing notes on your thought process and how you contructed the code. Including descisions, changes, tests etc.  
It sould be stressed that there are no wrong answers, it just gives us some additional insight when reviewing you as a fit for the Reelit team we are building.  

**Some examples of what you could note down:**
How you first designed (in your head or physically) how the system would work after reading the brief.  
What sources you used to find code that you could repurpose (if not written from scratch).  
Any problems you encountered.  
Decisions where you used one method over another and why.  
How long it took you and if you found it difficult or easy.  
Changes you would've liked to make if you had more time.  
Features you would like to add (or did).  
And any other notes you beleive might help us evaluate.
