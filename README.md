# Take Home Project

This is a project to review basic skills of applicants applying to be a Reelit developer. This is a relatively simple project, however don't feel pressured to finish quickly or get it perfect we are mostly just looking to have some insight into your thought process and approach a task like this.
---

### Outline of Task

We would like you to construct a web application that takes the output (basic reelit templates in an array) from a GET request to the placeholder API endpoint listed below, and then filters/orders that data slightly and displays it on the page.

*https://my-json-server.typicode.com/reelit/reelittakehome/templates*

The created web page should open with a "GET TEMPLATES" button in the center. When this button is pressed, hide the button, fetch the data from the endpoint, filter/order it as described below and then display the filtered/ordered data on the page with some basic formatting (however you would like).

**Filtering**  
Filter the data to only show templates with a "template_genre" field of "genre_1", remove any others.

**Ordering**  
Order the data by "total_length" desc.

### Platform Choice

Python where possible, with any frameworks/libraries.  
Basic HTML and CSS, with any frameworks/libraries.  
JavaScript can also be used if needed, with any frameworks/libraries. 

Use any IDE/tools that you are comfortable with.
