# Take Home Project

This is a project to review basic skills of Reelit applications. This is a relatively simple project, however don't feel pressured to finish or get it 100% perfect we are mostly just looking to have some insight into your thought process and approach a task like this.

### Outline of Task

The project is relatively simple. We would like you to construct a web application that takes the output from a GET request to the placeholder API endpoint listed below, and then filter/order that data (basic reelit templates in an array) slightly and display it on the page.

*https://my-json-server.typicode.com/reelit/reelittakehome/templates*

The created web page should open with a "GET TEMPLATES" button in the center. When the go button is pressed, hide the button, fetch the data from the endpoint filter/order it as described below and then display the filtered/ordered data on the page with some basic formatting (however you would like).

*Filtering*
Filter the data to only show templates with a "template_genre" field of "genre_1", remove any others.

*Ordering*
Order the data by "total_length" desc.

### Platform Choice

We would like you to create the project as a web application in any of the following platforms.

Python where possible, with any frameworks/libraries.
Basic HTML and CSS, with any frameworks/libraries.
JavaScript can also be used if needed, with any frameworks/libraries.
